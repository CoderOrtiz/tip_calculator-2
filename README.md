# Tip Calculator 2
This Tip Calculator incorporates an Arrow Function

## Description:

This is my fourth coding challenge from, "The Complete JavaScript Course 2022". In this challenge I used an arrow function nested within a function expression to compare two different set values and calculate the average. I called the function twice under two separate variables with different values. The arrow function averaged both invoked values and provided and output that was then compared using If Else Statements. A team needed to score twice the points of the other team to win.

## How the Challenge Turned Out:

This is the first time working with Arrow Functions which was different compared to Function Declarations and Function Expressions. I failed at having the user choose their own values to be calculated. Even when using Number (Type Conversion), the numbers would return NaN (Not a Number). As a result, I stuck with the set values and decided to just show my work. Coming up with the solution was not too difficult after I reviewed how to write an Arrow Function, but unfortunately, a lot of time was spent trying to let the user chose their own inputs. I am sure I'll learn the solution to my dilemma soon.
